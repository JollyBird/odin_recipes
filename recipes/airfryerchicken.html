        <h1>Ingredients:</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon onion powder</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cornstarch</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons avocado oil</li>
            <li>1 pound boneless skinless chicken breasts</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Directions:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Cut the the chicken into thin pieces: </strong>Cut each chicken breast into thin, flat pieces (not bite-sized but something that looks like a thin chicken breast). <br>
                    For example: if a one-pound package gives me two chicken breasts, I’m often cutting it into 3-4 thin pieces per breast. <br>
                    Thin chicken is essential! And delicious! Pat the chicken breasts dry if they have a lot of moisture on them.</li>
                <li><strong>Coat the chicken with spices: </strong>Toss the spices together so they’re mixed well; sprinkle mixture over the chicken pieces in a bowl. <br>
                    Add the oil and toss (I use my hands but tongs will work). You want to thoroughly coat the chicken. <br>
                    You can give it a short rest if you want, but I find that the flavor is excellent even if it just goes straight into the air fryer, and that’s how I usually make it.</li>
                <li><strong>Air fry: </strong>Preheat the air fryer. Place the chicken on the air fryer basket / grate in an even layer, leaving a bit of space for air to circulate around. <br>
                    Air fry the chicken at 415 degrees for 10 minutes. If you have larger pieces of chicken, you’ll want to go closer to 13 minutes. <br>
                    You’re looking for an internal temperature of 165 degrees.</li>
                <li><strong>You’re done! Yum! </strong>It should be a gorgeous sight for hungry eyes. Crisped on the outside, full of flavor, and juicy to the max. <br>
                    Let it rest for a moment; then slice into it and enjoy. We often eat at least half of it just hot out of the air fryer while standing over the cutting board. <br>
                    I am on a kick with dunking the chicken pieces in a house-made gochujang dipping sauce which is in the notes below!</li>
